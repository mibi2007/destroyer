## Inspiration:

I enjoy platformer games with abilities, skills, and fantasy storylines. As a passionate Dota 2 player, I decided to incorporate some skills from it into my own game as a personal project.

## What the Game Offers:

This game is built using Flutter and the Flame engine, which are ideal for indie game development.

## Development Process:

I created this game over a period of two months. The game assets are mostly stored in the [design](https://github.com/mibi2007/destroyer/tree/main/design) folder. I began by outlining the [game story](https://github.com/mibi2007/destroyer/blob/main/README/game_play.md) and then coding the game based on it. I shared my progress updates on the post [here](https://www.facebook.com/groups/fluttervn/permalink/1587034758499623/)
where I received valuable support from the community. The **Flutter Game Community** on Discord [here](https://discord.gg/KpTYYRRv) also provided me with constant encouragement.

## Challenges:

As this is my first completed game, I sometimes struggled with my own ideas, questioning their feasibility. For example, the ability to use left and right mouse clicks to aim between the mouse and player required centering the player on the screen. However, I would have preferred a camera that followed the player with bounds. Designing the [skills](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SkZcQCbS1xXX0g-EWKh6Wfhe5EqCJsat30RK-UWMxYc/edit#heading=h.o04ctsrryum5) was also complex, but I managed to simplify them and reuse logic thanks to the flame_behaviors library.

## Accomplishments:

After completing the game, I played it extensively and was filled with ideas for future additions. I am eager to implement these upgrades, as I find it quite addictive. Destroyer currently support web, windows and android, the most completed features is on desktop.

## Lessons Learned:

Through this project, I gained experience in image editing, sprite animation, game map creation using Tiled, collision detection, and timing effects. I even created my own effects system that accurately reflects the intended skill effects.

## Future Plans for "Destroyer":

Currently, my game has only two maps, but I plan to add five more to complete it. Additionally, I am thrilled to announce that multiplayer support will be added soon, with a dedicated server already in place. Furthermore, I intend to enhance the game's visuals using Flutter shaders once they are stabilized.
