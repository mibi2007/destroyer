## Inspiration

I love to play platformer games with items, skills and fantasy game story. Dota 2 is also my favorite game so I took some skills from it put to my game just for fun.

## What it does

This game build with Flutter and Flame engine, a perfect match to create indie game for now IMHO

## How we built it

I made it in 2 months. Most of the assets I made is in the [design](https://github.com/mibi2007/destroyer/tree/main/design) folder. I created (game story)[https://github.com/mibi2007/destroyer/blob/main/README/game_play.md] first. Then started coding follow it. My game progress was updated in Flutter Vietnam post (here)[https://www.facebook.com/groups/fluttervn/permalink/1587034758499623/]
A lot of my friends in this small community give me the inspiration. The **Flutter Game Community** on Discord (here)[https://discord.gg/KpTYYRRv] is my best companion

## Challenges we ran into

This is my very first game that I have completed so I have sometimes stroggle with my own ideas because I am not sure it is doable. Ex use mouse left and right click, aiming direction between mouse and player. I have to center my player on the screen to do that but I will happier if I can make the camera follow with bounds. The skills is very complicated to me, thanks to flame_behaviors I can split the logic and reuse it

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

After finish it, I play a lot, many many ideas are coming, I can't wait to add it to my game, quire addicted

## What we learned

I learn so many things, from editing image, create sprite animation, create game map with Tiled app, working with collisions and timing effects. I have build my own effects system that can reflect exactly the skill effect that I need

## What's next for Destroyer

For now my game only has 2 maps, I will add 5 more to complete it. More than that, the most exiting is I will add support for multiplayer, I already have gave server for it. The game effect will improve with Flutter shader when it is stable

# Processing
